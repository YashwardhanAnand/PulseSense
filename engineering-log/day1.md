Goal for today:
Follow Paul McWhorter’s first Arduino lesson and understand basic LED control.

What I expected to happen:
I thought blinking an LED would just be a basic coding exercise with no real insight with a fake enthusiasm of having "built" something.

What actually happened:
I learned how delay timing affects perception and discovered that below a certain delay,
the LED no longer appears to blink to my eyes.

What broke / confused me:
At very small delay values, I couldn’t tell if the LED was blinking or just dim.

Hypothesis:
There is a minimum blink interval below which human vision perceives the LED as continuous.

What I tried:
I reduced the delay value step by step and observed when blinking stopped being perceptible.

Result:
I found that around a delay value of 15 ms, I could no longer reliably perceive blinking.

Next step:
Look into why human vision has this limit and whether this changes under different lighting conditions.
P.s.
learnt 2 things-
Paul Mcwhorter is the coolest guy on youtube.
This is so COOL!
