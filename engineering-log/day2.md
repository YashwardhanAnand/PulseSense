Goal for today: Follow Paul McWhorter’s second Arduino lesson and understand how LEDS work.

What I expected to happen: I expected as always a boring theory session before the real fun comes in.

What actually happened: I learnt of ideas which i have already learnt before but in a way where they were no longer mystical and abstract but relatable.. like the idea of variation in voltage as tilting the slopes to alter flow of current really put a smile on my face.

What broke / confused me: The initial explanation went over my head and puzzled me but when i sat down and visualized the process, i understood it more clearly. Lesson-visualization is the best mode of comprehension in this field.

Next step: go to bed.. lol.. and keep the moment on.
